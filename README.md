# SQL Data Exploration Project

This SQL code explores COVID-19 data stored in a SQL Server database. The data is from the [PortfolioProject] database and includes two tables: `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccination`.

## Key Insights

1. **Total Cases vs Total Deaths and Death Percentage**: This section calculates the death percentage by dividing the total deaths by the total cases for each location and date.

2. **Total Cases vs Population**: This section calculates the infection rate percentage by dividing the total cases by the population for each location and date.

3. **Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population**: This section finds the countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population.

4. **Highest Death Count per Population**: This section finds the countries with the highest death count per population.

5. **Global Numbers**: This section calculates the total cases, total ICU patients, total deaths, and death rate percentage for each day.

6. **Joining Vaccination and Death Tables**: This section joins the `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccination` tables to explore the relationship between vaccinations and deaths.

7. **Rolling People Vaccinated**: This section uses a CTE (Common Table Expression) and a Temp Table to calculate the rolling number of people vaccinated and the percentage of the population vaccinated.

8. **Creating Views**: This section creates two views: `PercentageVaccination` and `DeathPercentage` to store the data for later visualization.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have access to the SQL Server database with the `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccination` tables.
2. Copy the SQL code from the provided file.
3. Run the code in a SQL editor or tool of your choice.
4. Explore the data and insights generated by the queries.

## Future Improvements

- Implement error handling for potential null or missing data.
- Expand the analysis to include more detailed insights and visualizations.
- Automate the data exploration process for regular updates and monitoring.
